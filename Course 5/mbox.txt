Yup, I think this is spot-on. Either/or, in reality, is actually neither
and both. We've had many discussions internally at SUNY about just how
loose our coupling can be. You start from either end and you work toward
the middle. But as a teaching and learning person, as a person who is
going to live in this app every day, I feel a strong sense of personal
urgency to put the issue of the long tail of learning applications as a
core design concern (which is why, by the way, that I think this
discussion belongs on the dev list and not the advocacy list). This is
not an issue of making your LMS cooler or sexier or more interesting.
It's about making it more *useful*. Regardless of whether "LMS" or "VLE"
is your preferred term, there is an "L" in there somewhere. 

Look, I'm a teacher. I don't care whether you guys decide to use flux
capacitor or an oscillating overthruster. I just want a good environment
to teach in. And my perspective as a teacher is that this long tail
issue is really, really important. Any LMS design that doesn't take it
very seriously as a core design requirement, IMHO, is not really
addressing the "L" the way it needs to be addressed in next-generation
learning environments.

I would add that, from my perspective, this debate also isn't really
about Sakai vs. something else. SUNY has particular needs which favor a
particular implementation strategy. That's a relatively local concern of
one institution. In the biggest picture, SUNY doesn't matter that much.
Neither does Sakai. What matters is that the global community is in the
midst of thinking through next-generation learning environment design.
As John points out, we agree on a lot. But the devil is in the details.

Kindest regards,
Michael

I should chip in her as Dan's PHB :)

Our strategy at Cambridge is to try and get the best of both worlds. I
am dismayed by the either/or tone of many discussions on this topic. If
you start from a monolithic place you will find yourself wanting/needing
to be loosening things up. If you start from a very loosely coupled
place you will find yourself wanting to provide some coordination
(broker service in SUNY plans I think).

Although the Sakai project and the SUNY design (and others) are at
different places on the spectrum I hope we can have conversations that
lead to learning from each other and conversion, or at least an
understanding of when one approach is better than another and when it is
not.

John

PS and from my point of view Dan is free to continue to voice his
opinions. He has had an interesting experience of building a custom LMS
for a multi-departmental course based on Wiki technology before joining
CARET.

But perhaps some of this belongs on the strategy and advocacy list
rather than Dev?
